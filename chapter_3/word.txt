The strategic guidance by and close contact between the heads of state of China and Russia serve as powerful engines for the development of bilateral relations, Wang said.

Noting that this was Xi's seventh visit to Russia as president and first attendance at the EEF, Wang said the trip carried on the tradition that China and Russia support each other in holding major events.

Xi and Putin had their third meeting in four months, charting the future course of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and exchanging views on major international and regional issues, Wang said.

That has highlighted the height and uniqueness of the China-Russia relationship, he added.

The two sides agreed to tighten strategic coordination, firmly support each other, and safeguard their own interests as well as the common interests of the international community, he said.
